> Snax By God | Data

Snaxdata is a repository dedicated to preserving all data pertaining to ZVZ. <br/>
Metadata describing all 12 Snacks from the SBG SZN II series are preserved in a single [JSON file](db.json).

For more information about the collection, check out our [Nutrition Facts](Nutrition.md). <br/><br/>

> [!NOTE]
> All Snacks are stored on the Polygon Blockchain under the ERC-1155 token standard. This means faster and cheaper transactions when trading your NFTs. This also entails greater privacy, security, and autonimity over your ZVZ due to the network's decentralized structure.
