> Snax By God | Data

Snaxdata is a repository dedicated to preserving all data pertaining to ZVZ.  Links to all 12 Snacks from the SBG SZN II series, including transaction details, are preserved in a single [JSON file](db.json).

> [!NOTE]
> All Snacks are stored on the Polygon Blockchain under the ERC-1155 token standard. This means faster and cheaper transactions when trading your NFTs. This also entails greater privacy, security, and autonimity over your ZVZ due to the network's decentralized structure.
